No line of this code presented here is free of charge:
* neither the mere concept of using modular exponential as an index to shuffle an array,
* or the idea of summing up elements of such shuffled arrays inbetween permutation layers with modular arithmetic
  * to hinder the calculation of the final discrete logarithm,
   * which if done would characterize the sub-permutations through simple factoring
* or the idea of using multi-dimensional data
  * and permuting it in all of its dimensions
  *  like a 3D cube here, whose sheets, rows and columns are all permuted in each iteration according to diverse portions of the key
* or increasing the number of inputs of the modular sums per iteration, to make it less possible to follow how input bits affect output ones (choosen plain texts, related keys)
