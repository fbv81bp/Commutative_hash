No line of this code presented here is free of charge:
* neither the mere concept of using modular exponential as an index to shuffle an array,
* or the idea of summing up elements of such shuffled arrays inbetween permutation layers with modular arithmetic
* to hinder the calculation of the final discrete logarithm,
* which if done would characterize the sub-permutations through simple factoring.
